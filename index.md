## ⚡ Technical Philosophy
As a Researcher and Engineer, I bridge the gap between **pure mathematical logic** and **scalable industrial deployment**. My approach focuses on "The Gem"—finding the core inductive bias that allows a system to outperform standard "black-box" models.

## 🧪 Core Framework: GCNRW (Graph Convolutional Random Walk)
*MSc Thesis Project | Grade: 18.60/20 (Top 1%)*

After 5 months of deep architectural iteration, I developed **GCNRW**, a framework that solves the convergence bottleneck in heterophilic graphs by integrating **Random Walk Transition Matrices** directly into the spectral filtering process.

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Rather than relying on the static Graph Laplacian $L = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$, GCNRW utilizes a diffusion-based transition operator:
$$P^k = (D^{-1}A)^k$$
This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and non-stationary signals that standard GCNs fail to resolve.
